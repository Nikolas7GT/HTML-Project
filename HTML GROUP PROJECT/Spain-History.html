<h1>•History of Spain</h1>
<div class="section">
<p>Spain, located on the Iberian Peninsula in southwestern Europe, has a rich and complex history shaped by many civilizations. From the ancient Iberians and Romans to the Visigoths and Muslims of Al-Andalus, the peninsula has been a crossroads of cultures. The Christian kingdoms gradually reconquered the territory in the Reconquista, culminating in 1492 with the fall of Granada. That same year marked the beginning of Spain’s global influence through exploration and empire-building in the Americas. Over the centuries, Spain experienced periods of imperial glory, political turmoil, and dictatorship under Franco, before transitioning to a modern democratic monarchy. Today, its history is reflected in its diverse architecture, vibrant culture, and enduring traditions.</p>

<h2>1. Roman Hispania (218 BCE – 5th Century CE)</h2>
<div class="section">
<p>The Roman conquest of the Iberian Peninsula brought profound changes to the region. Romans introduced Latin, which laid the foundation for the Spanish language, along with Roman law, infrastructure, and urban planning. Cities like Tarragona, Mérida, and Córdoba flourished, and agriculture, trade, and mining developed significantly. This period also integrated Hispania into the broader Mediterranean world, creating cultural and administrative continuity that influenced later kingdoms.</p>

<h2>2. Al-Andalus and the Muslim Era (711–1492)</h2>
<div class="section">
<p>The Muslim invasion in 711 CE marked the beginning of Al-Andalus, a period of scientific, artistic, and cultural achievement. Under the Caliphate of Córdoba, Spain became a center of learning, architecture, and philosophy. Agriculture and trade expanded, and diverse religious communities (Muslims, Christians, Jews) coexisted, though not always peacefully. The eventual fragmentation into taifa kingdoms and the rise of Christian Reconquista shaped centuries of conflict and cultural fusion.</p>

<h2>3. The Spanish Empire and the Age of Exploration (15th–17th Century)</h2>
<div class="section">

<p>The Spanish Empire and the Age of Exploration marked a turning point in Spain’s history and global influence. In the late 15th century, Spain unified under Ferdinand and Isabella and completed the Reconquista in 1492. That same year, Christopher Columbus’s voyage led to the European discovery of the Americas. Spain rapidly built one of the largest empires in history, stretching across the Americas, parts of Europe, Africa, and Asia. Vast wealth flowed into Spain from colonies, especially in gold and silver. This period also saw the spread of Spanish language, culture, and Christianity. Spain became a dominant military and political power in Europe. The era produced a cultural Golden Age in art and literature. However, constant wars and economic mismanagement weakened the empire. By the 17th century, Spain’s global dominance began to decline despite its lasting influence.</p>

<h2>4. 20th Century: Civil War and Franco’s Dictatorship (1936–1975)</h2>
<div class="section">
<img src="images/Francisco_Franco_1930.jpg">
<p>The 20th century in Spain was marked by the Spanish Civil War and Franco’s dictatorship, a period of deep political and social upheaval. The civil war began in 1936 between Republican forces, who supported democracy, and Nationalists led by Francisco Franco. The conflict was brutal, with widespread violence, destruction, and loss of life. In 1939, Franco’s Nationalists won, establishing an authoritarian regime that lasted until his death in 1975. During his rule, political opposition was suppressed, regional identities were restricted, and censorship was strictly enforced. Despite repression, Spain experienced economic modernization in the later years of Franco’s dictatorship. The regime promoted nationalism and traditional values while isolating Spain from much of the international community. Education, media, and public life were heavily controlled by the state. Franco’s rule left deep scars on Spanish society but also set the stage for the later transition to democracy. The end of the dictatorship marked the beginning of a new era in Spanish history.</p>

<h2>Spain Today</h2>
<div class="section">
<p>Modern Spain is a democratic parliamentary monarchy, a member of the European Union, and a country that balances rich historical heritage with contemporary culture. It is known for its vibrant cities, diverse landscapes, artistic contributions, and strong tourism and cultural industries. Spain continues to embrace its multicultural past while facing modern challenges, including political decentralization and economic modernization.</p>

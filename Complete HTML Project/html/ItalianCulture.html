        <h3><a id="Population"></a>Population of Italy</h3>

        <p>According to the Italian National Institute of Statistics, Italy is home to approximately 59.6 million individuals as of January 1, 2020. About 96 percent of the population are ethnic Italians, though many other 
            ethnic groups also live in the country, including North African Arabs, Italo-Albanians, Albanians, Germans, Austrians, and other European communities.
        </p>
        
        <p>Italy’s neighboring countries—France, Switzerland, Austria, and Slovenia—as well as the Mediterranean islands of Sardinia and Sicily, have influenced Italian culture.
        </p>
        
        <p>Of the total population, 48.7 percent are men and 51.3 percent are women. Children up to age 15 account for 13 percent of the population, 63.8 percent are aged 15–64, and 23.2 percent are 65 or older. 
            Over 14,800 people are aged 100 or more.
        </p>
        
        <p>The largest share of the population lives in northwest Italy. Rome is the largest city with over 2.8 million residents, while Morterone is the smallest municipality, with around 30 inhabitants.
        </p>

        <h3><a id="Languages"></a>Languages of Italy</h3>
        
        <p>Italian is the official language of the country, and approximately 93 percent of the population speaks it as their native language. Italy is also home to numerous regional dialects, including Sardinian, Friulian, 
            Neapolitan, Sicilian, Ligurian, Piedmontese, Venetian, and Calabrian.
        </p>
        
        <p>Other languages spoken by native Italians include Albanian, Bavarian, Catalan, Cimbrian, Corsican, Croatian, French, German, Greek, Slovenian, and Walser.
        </p>

        <h3><a id="Family"></a>Family Life in Italy</h3>

        <p>Family is an extremely important value within Italian culture. Family solidarity traditionally focuses on the extended family rather than the nuclear family model common in Western societies.
        </p>
        
        <p>Italians frequently gather with relatives and enjoy spending time together. Children are often encouraged to remain close to their families into adulthood and to integrate their own families into the broader 
            family network.
        </p>
        
        <p>Over the past 60 years, the family structure has evolved. The average age of marriage has increased to 31 for women and 34 for men, reflecting greater cohabitation before marriage and a general decline in 
            marriage rates.
        </p>

        <h3><a id="Religion"></a>Religion in Italy</h3>
        
        <p>The predominant religion in Italy is Roman Catholicism, largely due to Vatican City being located in Rome. Roman Catholics and other Christians make up about 80 percent of the population, though only around 
            one-third actively practice.
        </p>

        <p>Italy also has a growing Muslim immigrant community. Muslims, agnostics, and atheists together account for roughly 20 percent of the population.
        </p>

        <p>Attendance at weekly religious services has declined in recent years, dropping from over 18 million attendees in 2006 to approximately 12 million in 2020.
        </p>

        <h3><a id="Art"></a>Art and Architecture in Italy</h3>

        </p>

        <p>The concept of the basilica originated in Italy, evolving from a Roman public building into a Catholic pilgrimage site. The term derives from Latin and Greek words meaning “royal.”

            Michelangelo between 1508 and 1512.
        </p>

        <p>Italy has a centuries-long operatic tradition. Opera originated in Italy, and many famous works by composers such as Giuseppe Verdi and Ruggero Leoncavallo are still performed in Italian today. Luciano 
            Pavarotti later helped bring opera to a wider audience.
        </p>

        <h3><a id="Food"></a>Italian Food</h3>

        <p>Italian cuisine has influenced food culture worldwide and is often regarded as an art form. Wine, cheese, and pasta are central to Italian meals, and pasta comes in a wide variety of shapes and styles.
        </p>

        <p>For Italians, food is more than nourishment—it is a central part of life. Family gatherings are frequent and often revolve around shared meals.
        </p>

        <p>Italian food varies greatly by region. Northern Italy favors ingredients such as fish, rice, potatoes, pork, sausages, and cheese, while central Italy is known for dishes like pizza. Southern Italian 
            cuisine features tomatoes, olive oil, garlic, capers, peppers, eggplant, and ricotta cheese.

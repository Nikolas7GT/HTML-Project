<p>Spanish culture is a vibrant blend of history, tradition, and creativity, shaped by centuries of diverse influences from the Romans, Moors, and other civilizations. It is celebrated through flamenco music and dance, lively festivals like La Tomatina and Running of the Bulls, and a rich culinary tradition featuring tapas, paella, and regional specialties. Spain is also renowned for its contributions to art and literature, with figures like Velázquez, Goya, Picasso, and Cervantes leaving a lasting legacy. Family, community, and a love of social gatherings are central to daily life, making Spanish culture both colorful and deeply social.</p>

<p>Music and dance play a central role in Spanish culture and daily life. Spain is best known for flamenco, a powerful art form that combines singing, guitar playing, and expressive dance. Flamenco originated in Andalusia and reflects deep emotions such as passion, joy, and sorrow. Each movement and rhythm tells a story through the dancer’s body and expression. In addition to flamenco, Spain has many regional dances, such as the jota in Aragón and the sardana in Catalonia. Traditional Spanish music often features guitars, castanets, and hand clapping. Folk music varies greatly from region to region, reflecting local history and traditions. Music and dance are closely tied to festivals and celebrations throughout the country. They bring people together in public squares and family gatherings. Overall, Spanish music and dance are vibrant expressions of identity, emotion, and cultural heritage.</p>

<h2>4. Art and Literature</h2>
<div class="section">
<img src="../images/Culture3.jpg">
<p>Art and literature are fundamental parts of Spain’s cultural heritage and global influence. Spanish art has produced world-famous painters such as Velázquez, Goya, Picasso, and Dalí, whose works span classical, modern, and surrealist styles. Their paintings reflect Spanish history, society, and imagination. Spain’s museums, including the Prado and Reina Sofía, preserve these artistic treasures. In literature, Miguel de Cervantes is one of the most important figures, best known for Don Quixote. Spanish literature often explores themes of honor, identity, and human struggle. Poetry, theater, and novels have flourished across centuries. Together, Spanish art and literature continue to shape cultural expression both in Spain and around the world.</p>

<h2>5. Cuisine and Social Life</h2>
<div class="section">
<p>Spanish food is more than sustenance—it is a cultural experience. Tapas, paella, jamón ibérico, and regional specialties highlight local ingredients and culinary traditions. Meals are social events, emphasizing family, friendship, and community. The Spanish lifestyle values la sobremesa, the relaxed time spent talking after a meal, reflecting the importance of connection and leisure.</p>

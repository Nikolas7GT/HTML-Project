<p>
La Paella is one of Spain’s most famous and iconic dishes, originating from the Valencia region. It is a rice-based dish traditionally cooked in a wide, shallow pan and flavored with saffron, which gives it its distinctive golden color. Paella is commonly made with ingredients such as chicken, rabbit, seafood, green beans, and sometimes snails, depending on the region. The dish is known for its rich aroma, bold flavors, and the crispy layer of rice at the bottom of the pan, called socarrat. Paella is often shared during family gatherings and celebrations, making it a symbol of Spanish culture and togetherness.

The potatoes are slowly cooked until soft, then mixed with beaten eggs and gently fried to create a thick, round omelette with a soft interior.

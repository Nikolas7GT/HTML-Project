<div class="section">
<img src="../images/D1.jpg">
<p>La Sagrada Familia is one of the most famous and impressive landmarks in Spain, located in the city of Barcelona. It was designed by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí, who dedicated much of his life to its construction. Work on the basilica began in 1882 and continues today, making it one of the longest-running building projects in history. The design combines Gothic and Art Nouveau styles with Gaudí’s unique organic vision. Its exterior features detailed façades that represent different stages of the life of Jesus Christ. The towering spires dominate Barcelona’s skyline and symbolize religious themes. Inside, the church is filled with natural light from colorful stained-glass windows. The interior columns resemble trees, creating a forest-like atmosphere. La Sagrada Familia is both a place of worship and a masterpiece of art. It has become a powerful symbol of Barcelona’s creativity and cultural identity.</p>

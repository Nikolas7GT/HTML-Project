<h1>The great history of Britain</h1>

<h4>Take a chronological journey through the key periods in England's past. Explore thousands of years of history and discover how the changes that the country has seen can be traced through English Heritage's sites.</h4>

<h2>• Early England</h2>
<p>The earliest inhabitants of the British Isles were prehistoric hunter-gatherers, later followed by Celtic tribes who formed distinct cultures across what are now England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland. In AD 43, the Roman Empire invaded Britain, establishing control over much of the island and introducing roads, towns, written records, and new systems of government and trade. Roman rule lasted nearly four centuries, during which Britain became an important frontier province. When Roman forces withdrew around AD 410, the region was left vulnerable to invasion and political fragmentation.</p>

<h2>• Anglo-Saxons, Vikings, and the Norman Conquest</h2>
<p>After the Romans departed, Germanic tribes known as the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes migrated to Britain, forming several rival kingdoms that laid the foundations of England. From the late 8th century, Viking raiders and settlers from Scandinavia attacked coastal towns and established control over large areas known as the Danelaw. These invasions reshaped language, law, and culture. In 1066, William, Duke of Normandy, conquered England at the Battle of Hastings. The Norman Conquest transformed English society by introducing feudalism, a new aristocracy, stone castles, and stronger centralized royal authority.</p>

<h2>• Medieval Kingdoms and the Growth of Royal Power</h2>
<p>During the Middle Ages, England expanded its control over Wales, formally annexing it in the 13th century, while Scotland resisted English domination and remained independent despite major conflicts such as the Wars of Independence led by figures like William Wallace and Robert the Bruce. A key moment in English political history was the signing of the Magna Carta in 1215, which limited the king’s power and established the principle that even monarchs were subject to the law. Parliament gradually developed as an institution, increasing the role of nobles and later commoners in governance.</p>

<h2>• The Tudors, Reformation, and Civil War</h2>
<p>The 16th century was dominated by the Tudor dynasty, which brought stability after the Wars of the Roses. King Henry VIII broke away from the Roman Catholic Church, creating the Church of England and redistributing church lands, greatly strengthening royal finances and power. Religious tensions continued under his successors. In the 17th century, conflict between the monarchy and Parliament led to the English Civil War, resulting in the execution of King Charles I in 1649. Although the monarchy was later restored, Parliament emerged as the dominant political force, shaping Britain into a constitutional monarchy.</p>

<h2>• The Formation of the United Kingdom and the British Empire</h2>
<p>The Tudor period in the 16th century brought stability after decades of civil conflict known as the Wars of the Roses. Henry VIII’s break from the Catholic Church led to the English Reformation and the creation of the Church of England, permanently changing the nation’s religious identity. In the 17th century, tensions between monarchs and Parliament erupted into the English Civil War. The execution of King Charles I in 1649 shocked Europe and ultimately resulted in England becoming a constitutional monarchy where Parliament held lasting power.</p>

<h2>• Industrial England and the Modern Nation</h2>
<p>The 18th and 19th centuries transformed England through the Industrial Revolution, which began in cities like Manchester and Birmingham. Factories, railways, and new technologies reshaped everyday life and made England the heart of a global empire. In the 20th century, two world wars brought hardship but also major social reforms, including expanded education and healthcare. Today, England remains the largest and most influential part of the United Kingdom, blending centuries-old traditions with modern multicultural society and democratic institutions.</p>

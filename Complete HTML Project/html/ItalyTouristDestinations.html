                Italy is my favourite travel destination in Europe! And not just because of pizza, pasta and gelato, but because of the beautiful landscapes and travel destinations Italy has to offer.
            </p>

            <p>The peninsula of Italy, which stretches for around 1000 kilometres into the Mediterranean, is home to around 60 million inhabitants – and just as many tourists come here every year. No wonder, because as an 
                exciting and diverse country and centre of antiquity, Italy awaits you with breathtaking destinations. In summer it is mainly the south with its popular beaches and in winter the north enchants with fantastic s
                ki resorts. In spring and autumn, Italy attracts visitors to famous historic cities such as Milan and Venice, as well as to beautiful hiking trails in the mountains.
            </p>

            <p>I have put together my favourite and the most beautiful travel destinations in Italy in this post, with important information about the travel season and my own personal tips & hotel recommendations

        <h2><a id="Dolomites"></a>No. 1 – The Dolomites – one of the most beautiful travel destinations in Italy</h2>

        <img src="../images/Dolomites.png">
        
        <p>Italy’s northern border is formed by the Alps – the highest mountains in Europe. They stretch over 1000 kilometres and rise almost 5000 metres into the sky. The Dolomites are a small, self-contained mountain range 
            within the Alps. Typical are their bizarre peaks up to 3000 metres high with steep, lush green ridges that seem to protect the beautiful, deeply enclosed valleys and mountain lakes.
        </p>

        <h3>When is the best time to visit the Dolomites?</h3>

        <p>September and October are the best months for hiking, as the summer ends late and temperatures are still around 20 degrees Celsius. It’s not just the weather that is perfect for hiking at this time of the year, 
            but also the colourful landscape which autumn paints. You will be amazed by the breathtaking shades of red that spread out all around you. In winter, the Dolomites are one of the most snowy regions in Europe.
        </p>

        <h3>For whom are the Dolomites a top travel destination in Italy?</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Hiking enthusiasts</li>
            <li>Winter sports fans</li>
            <li>Spa lovers</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>My travel tips for the Dolomites:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>The best known is probably the Seiser Alm / Alpe di Siusi – a breathtaking alpine meadow landscape. Here you’ll find one amazing view after another, and you simply can’t get enough of it.</li>
            <li>For me, one of the most beautiful places in the Dolomites is the Seceda summit at 2500 metres above sea level with its almost fairytale-like shape.</li>
            <li>What a view! The famous Drei Zinnen / Tre Cime di Lavaredo are a popular hiking destination for good reason.</li>
            <li>Mountain lakes, such as Lago di Braies / Pragser Wildsee or Lago di Carezza / Karersee</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><a id="Milan"></a>No. 2 – Top Travel Destinations in Italy – Milan</h2>

        <img src="../images/milan.jpg">

        <p>Milan – metropolis and capital of the Lombardy – is definitely one of the most beautiful destinations in Italy and will enrich your holiday in this impressive country. Italy’s second largest city is also known as 
            a centre for fashion and design and offers numerous upscale boutiques, hotels and restaurants. Milan truly has a very special flair that you should take in.
        </p>

        <h3>When is the best time to visit Milan?</h3>

        <p>The best time to visit Milan is during the spring months, when the city is covered in a fantastic splendour of flowers. The city parks and the Indro Montanelli Gardens are in full bloom and invite you to 
            take long walks in mild temperatures. Everything is bathed in an enchanting light that gives the city an incomparable appearance. This makes it even more fun to explore all of Milan’s sights and linger in a pretty café.
        </p>

        <h3>For whom is Milan the ideal destination?</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>People interested in history</li>
            <li>Travelers who like international city flair</li>
            <li>Opera lovers</li>
            <li>Shopping enthusiasts</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>My tips for Milan, Italy</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>The Gothic Milan Cathedral in the centre of Piazza del Duomo</li>
            <li>The Dominican church of Santa Maria delle Grazie, which houses Leonardo da Vinci’s world-famous mural ‘The Last Supper’.</li>
            <li>La Scala – one of the most famous and important opera houses in the world</li>
            <li>Arco della Pace</li>
            <li>Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II shopping gallery</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><a id="Venice"></a>No. 3 – Venice – the most romantic travel destination in Italy</h2>

        <img src="../images/venice.jpeg">

        <p>For me, Venice is not only one of the most beautiful holiday destinations in Italy, but also one of the most romantic cities I have ever visited. Built on the water, the city on the Adriatic Sea is crossed by around 
            150 canals, over which beautiful and famous bridges swing, each one more beautiful than the other. Venice offers you a marvellous backdrop with great photo opportunities, as well as testimonies to its history that 
            are well worth seeing.
        </p>

        <h3>When is the best time to visit Venice?</h3>

        <p>Spring and autumn are also particularly good times to visit Venice to immerse yourself in the magic of the city and avoid the large crowds of tourists during the summer months.
        </p>

        <h3>For whom is Venice the ideal destination in Italy?</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Love birds or wedding couples</li>
            <li>Lovers of romantic architecture</li>
            <li>Those interested in history</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>My tips for Venice in Italy</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>The famous St. Mark’s Square / Piazza San Marco from the 11th century</li>
            <li>The highest tower in Venice, Campanile di San Marco, is located on St. Mark’s Square and offers a breathtaking view over the city</li>
            <li>The Doge’s Palace on St. Mark’s Square</li>
            <li>Most popular bridges: Rialto Bridge / Ponte di Rialto, Bridge of Sighs / Ponte dei Sospiri, Scalzi Bridge / Ponte degli Scalzi</li>
            <li>Of course, a gondola ride is an absolute must in Venice</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><a id="CinqueTerrePortofino"></a>No. 4 – Cinque Terre & Portofino – a top travel destination in Italy</h2>

        <img src="../images/vernazza.jpg">

        <h3>Cinque Terre</h3>

        <p>On the rugged Italian Riviera, there is a 12 kilometre stretch of coastline known as the Cinque Terre, which translates as Five Lands. This refers to five picturesque villages with a fairytale-like charm. It is wonderful 
            to stroll through the small alleyways between cute, colourful houses or sit comfortably in one of the cafés and simply gaze over the turquoise blue water.
        </p>

        <p>The names of the five villages are:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Monterosso al Mare</li>
            <li>Vernazza</li>
            <li>Corniglia</li>
            <li>Manarola</li>
            <li>Riomaggiore</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The Cinque Terre is best explored in two days with an overnight stay in one of the five small villages. However, it is better to leave your own car outside the national park, as it’s impossible to drive on 
            the small roads and alleys. Instead take the train or the hiking trail that connects the Cinque Terre. The entire walking route takes around 6-7 hours in total and can therefore be ideally divided into several 
            stages, with breaks in the villages and at viewpoints.
        </p>

        <h3>Portofino</h3>

        <p>Around 70 kilometres away from the Cinque Terre is the Ligurian village of Portofino – a former fishing village with a beautiful harbour where you can almost always marvel at the yachts that sometimes belong to 
            celebrities who like to anchor here. During your stay, you should definitely take a stroll along the world-famous Piazzetta Martiri dell’Òlivetta. You can enjoy great food in the stylish restaurants and have a 
            fantastic view of the marvelous backdrop.
        </p>

        <h3>When is the best time to visit the Cinque Terre and Portofino?</h3>
        
        <p>March to September is the best time to explore the beautiful area in mild or warm temperatures and simply relax outside.
        </p>

        <h3>For whom is the Cinque Terre & Portofino a top Italy travel destination?</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Holidaymakers who like to combine sightseeing and culture with hiking and nature</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>My tips for Cinque Terre & Portofino</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>My favourite photo spot in Manarola: one level above the famous Nessum Dorma restaurant, there is a cemetery with a fantastic view</li>
            <li>The Vernazza View Point – a picturesque vantage point over one of the Cinque Terre villages Vernazza. It is easy to find on the hiking trail that leads from Vernazza to the neighbouring village of Monterosso</li>
            <li>Baia Cannone in Portofino – the iconic little beach offers a great view of colourful villas by the water and is a great photo spot</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><a id="Tuscany"></a>No. 5 – Tuscany – one of the most beautiful travel destinations in Italy</h2>

        <img src="../images/florence.jpg">

        <p>Who doesn’t dream of seeing the breathtaking landscape of central Italy with its huge vineyards at least once in their life? And that’s not all that makes Tuscany worth a holiday in Italy. Here you will find very 
            special accommodation – small castles with great spa facilities as well as the healing thermal springs, of which the Terme di Saturnia is the most famous. Of course, a trip to Tuscany also includes a visit to the 
            famous cities of Florence, Siena and Pisa.
        </p>

        <h3>When is the best time to travel to Tuscany?</h3>

        <p>You should choose spring, when everything starts to bloom and Tuscany unfolds its magic. It is also more pleasant to visit the cities during this time – the temperatures are not as hot as in summer and there are 
            fewer tourists. Tuscany is also beautiful in autumn when the vineyards turn red and the landscape glows in a golden light.
        </p>

        <h3>For whom is Tuscany the ideal holiday destination?</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Wine lovers</li>
            <li>Those interested in art and history</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>My tips for Tuscany:</h3>

        <h4>Florence</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>The Galleria dell`Accademia with the original Renaissance statue ‘David’ by Michelangelo</li>
            <li>The Uffizi Art Museum, which is home to famous works by Botticelli, Michelangelo and Raphael, among others</li>
            <li>Florence Cathedral, also known as the Cathedral of St Mary of the Flower (Santa Maria del Fiore)</li>
            <li>The more than 1000-year-old Ponte Vecchio bridge</li>
            <li>The Palazzo Vecchio</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Siena</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>The Gothic town hall Palazzo Pubblico on the main square, Piazza del Campo</li>
            <li>The 87 metre high Torre del Mangia, also in the Piazza del Campo, from where you can enjoy a wonderful panoramic view</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Pisa</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>An absolute must: the so-called Leaning Tower of Pisa in Piazza dei Miracoli – a 56-metre-high bell tower made of white marble, which also offers a spectacular view once you have climbed the steps to the top</li>
            <li>The Romanesque Cathedral of Santa Maria Assunta, made of striped marble, right next to the tower</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><a id="Rome"></a>No. 6 – Rome – a magnificent travel destinations in Italy</h2>

        <img src="../images/Rome.jpg">

        <p>Most visitors to Italy flock to Rome, around 9 million every year. No wonder, because Rome epitomises pure antiquity. For over 400 years, the ancient Roman Empire ruled the entire world from here. The ruins from 
            this period are enormous and have lost none of their imposing presence.
        </p>

        <h3>When is the best time to visit Rome?</h3>

        <p>It is also advisable to avoid the summer months in Rome, not only because of the heat but also because of the crowds of tourists. Spring and autumn are the best times to explore this wonderful city.
        </p>

        <h3>For whom is Rome a top travel destination in Italy?</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Travellers interested in art and history</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>My tips for Rome in Italy:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>The Forum Romanum – the centre of life in antiquity and the oldest Roman forum – was built on a former swamp, which required a water drainage system that still functions today. Among other things, the famous, 
                still preserved Arch of Titus is located here.</li>
            <li>The Colosseum – the most impressive and largest ancient amphitheatre in the world</li>
            <li>The Pantheon – an ancient building that was later consecrated as a church, with the beautiful Trevi Fountain in front of it</li>
            <li>The famous Spanish Steps</li>
            <li>Vatican City, with St. Peter’s Basilica and the Vatican Museum – in the Sistine Chapel is the famous fresco by Michelangelo</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><a id="AmalfiCoastNaples"></a>No. 7 – Amalfi Coast & Naples</h2>

        <img src="../images/naples.jpg">

        <p>On the west coast, around 40 kilometres south of Naples, you will find another of Italy’s most beautiful destinations – the popular Amalfi Coast. This is where the dream of a beach holiday comes true, surrounded 
            by beautiful nature and enchanting villages. Towering cliffs behind rugged beaches characterise the typical image of the Amalfi Coast. During a holiday, it is definitely worth exploring several places to experience 
            the full beauty of the Amalfi Coast.
        </p>

        <p>As already mentioned, the Amalfi Coast is located near Naples. You should definitely not miss the legendary city on your trip. According to a myth, Odysseus sailed in the dangerous waters off Naples and was 
            bewitched by the sirens. However, he was able to escape them by tying himself to the mast. Naples is simply beautiful with its marvellous location at the foot of Mount Vesuvius. 
        </p>

        <h3>When is the best time to visit the Amalfi Coast & Naples?</h3>

        <p>The Amalfi Coast is a popular holiday destination not only for tourists but also for locals. You should therefore avoid the summer holidays. Late spring and the first months of autumn are best. You can swim and 
            stroll through the villages in pleasant temperatures. It’s also not so hot if you want to explore Naples.
        </p>

        <h3>For whom are the Amalfi Coast & Naples the best travel destination in Italy?</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Beach holidaymakers</li>
            <li>Those interested in history</li>
            <li>Friends of city breaks</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>My tips for the Amalfi Coast</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>The famous town of Positano, which was built on a rock, with the beautiful Positano Beach, which you should definitely visit at sunset</li>
            <li>Amalfi – a town absolutely worth seeing on the coast of the same name</li>
            <li>The cute little village of Ravello – for me one of the most beautiful on the Amalfi Coast – is located in the mountains and offers you a fantastic view over the entire coast.</li>
            <li>The island of Capri is only about 50-80 minutes away from the Amalfi Coast by ferry.</li>
            <li>Pompeii – very close to the Amalfi Coast. Probably the most famous archaeological site in the world, it was buried metres deep in 79 AD during a devastating eruption of Mount Vesuvius 
                and only discovered by chance in the middle of the 18th century.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>My tips for Naples</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>You should definitely take a stroll through the beautiful historic centre and enjoy the view of Mount Vesuvius from one of the many cafés.</li>
            <li>Naples Cathedral with its partly gilded coffered ceiling in the nave </li>
            <li>The National Archaeological Museum, where you will find artefacts from Pompeii, among other things</li>

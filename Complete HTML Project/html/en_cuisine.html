<h1>The tasty and flavorful England dishes and treats</h1>

<h4>Observe some local dishes that will make your mouth drool.</h4>

<h2>1. Fish and Chips</h2>

<img src="../images/fishandchips.jpg">
<p>Fish and chips is one of England's most famous meals. It is made by coating white fish (usually cod or haddock) in batter and deep-frying it until golden, then serving it with thick-cut fried potatoes. It became popular in the 19th century among working-class communities because it was cheap, filling, and easy to serve. Today, it remains a national favorite, often eaten from paper near the seaside.</p>

<h2>2. Full English Breakfast</h2>

<p>This hearty breakfast usually includes fried eggs, bacon, sausages, baked beans, mushrooms, tomatoes, and toast. Everything is cooked in a pan or grill and served hot on one plate. The dish developed during the Victorian era as a large meal for workers who needed energy for long days of labor. It has since become a symbol of traditional English comfort food.</p>

<h2>3. Sunday Roast</h2>

<p>A Sunday roast consists of roasted meat (commonly beef, chicken, or lamb), potatoes, vegetables, gravy, and Yorkshire pudding. The meat is slowly roasted in the oven while potatoes are cooked in fat until crispy. This tradition dates back hundreds of years and became especially popular after church services on Sundays, when families gathered for their main meal of the week.</p>

<h2>4. Shepherd's Pie</h2>

<p>Shepherd's pie is made with minced lamb cooked in gravy with onions, carrots, and peas, then topped with mashed potatoes and baked until golden. (When beef is used, it is called cottage pie.) The dish originated in the late 18th century as a way to reuse leftover roasted meat, helping families avoid wasting food.</p>

<h2>5. Yorkshire Pudding</h2>

<img src="../images/YorkshirePudding.jpg">
<p>Yorkshire pudding is made from a simple batter of eggs, flour, and milk, baked in hot oil until it rises and becomes crispy on the outside and soft inside. It was first served in northern England in the 1700s as a cheap way to fill people before the main meat course, making expensive meat portions last longer.</p>

<h2>6. Cornish Pasty</h2>

<p>This baked pastry is filled with beef, potatoes, onions, and turnips, folded into a half-moon shape. It comes from Cornwall, where miners in the 19th century carried them underground as lunch. The thick crust acted as a handle so miners could eat without dirtying the food, then throw the crust away.</p>

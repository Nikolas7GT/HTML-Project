<h1>My name is Nikolas</h1>

<h4>I have decided to dedicate the personal page that has been given to me to talk a little bit about myself</h4>

<p>My name is Nikolas Pantazoglou, I was born on the 25th of June, 2006, and I am currently 19 years old.</p>
<p>I was born and currently live in Greece, although I have temporarily lived on other countries, such as England (for 2,5 years) and Bulgaria (for half a year).</p>
<p>I studied veterinairy medicine in Bulgaria prior to my studies currently in Computer Science, however I had to stop attending that university due to multiple personal reasons.</p>
<p>I have always been fascinated by art, animation and videogames, so I know that I want my future job to revolve around one, if not all of these.</p>
<p>When I found out I can study computer science, I was pretty excited, knowing that I will learn to code and gain skills required to become a game developer.</p>
<p>Although that dream of mine looks sort of hard to achieve, I will chase it as much as I humanly can, because creating is my passion and I love making things for other people to enjoy.</p>
<p>Until then, I will continue to create no matter what circumstance. Whether that is drawing, editing videos, or even making websites such as this one.</p>
<p>In the near future, I hope to have all the necessary skills to put all my thoughts into a canvas.</p>
<h4>Thank you for reading about me.</h4>

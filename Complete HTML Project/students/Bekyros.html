        <h3>About me</h3>

        <p>I am 25 years old and I am currently studying at <a href="https://www.athtech.gr/?gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=13798687089&gbraid=0AAAAACUBg-VgQoURTzpDeFaS2aACqcJTW&gclid=CjwKCAiAybfLBhAjEiwAI0mBBsN2GpKDETbY__M2__x_SAUCe0FvqSzkdJkBbXtVi87_ONhIXQEnKBoCsOwQAvD_BwE">
            Athens Tech College</a>, which is part of the <a href="https://york.citycollege.eu/frontend/index.php">University of York</a> family.
        </p>

        <p>Earlier in my life, I used to play football for Vouliagmeni Athletic Club and trying out canoe-kayak.
        </p>

        <p>Later on, i joined my school's chess team and participated in a few tournaments. I also was part of a photoshop school group which focused on 
            learning how to use the app and created several school collages of photos from trips that the students went on.
        </p>

        <p>After graduating, I studied in the National Technical University of Athens in Electric and Computer Engineering. Unfortunately due to personal 
            reason i was able to finish the school.
        </p>

        <p>I worked for a 5 months as an intern programmer at Cromemco Hellas and for 10 months at Pet City Group.
        </p>

        <p>I have a dog named Spike. He is a lovely, though sometimes a menace, 6 year-old beagle and he will literally do anything if you have a piece of food
            in your hand, otherwise he is like talking or interacting with a brick wall
            <br>
            <button onclick="spikeFunFact()">Click here for a fun fact about Spike</button>
        </p>

         <p>I like programming and I want to become either a game developer or work in cyber security when I graduate Athens Tech.
         </p>

         <br>

         <h3>About this project</h3>

         <p>In this project I learned how to cooperate with my fellow students and the basics of how to write and develop a website. It was a fun 
            experience, though there were some difficulties we had to get through.
         </p>

         <p>I am looking forward to more group projects like this one in the future
         </p>
